# Pixel Duel


## Overview
---

Pixel duel is a lo-fi fencing game created as an homage to old freeware games of the early DOS gaming era.  It features a simultaneous 2 player VS mode played side by side on a single keyboard.  The gameplay is enhanced by an 8-bit inspired sountrack and synthesized sound effects.  Duel it out with a friend to see who is the champion!
